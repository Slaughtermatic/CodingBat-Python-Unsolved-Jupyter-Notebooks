# CodingBat-Python-Unsolved-Jupyter-Notebooks
A collection of JupyterNotebooks containing the unsolved practice problems at Codingbat.com/Python for easier working.
<br>
<br>
I recently finished up all of the exercises on the [Python side of CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/python). 
<br>
I imported them into Jupyter Notebooks as I went cause they were just kind of easier to work with than the website. 
<br>
When I finished them I went through and removed all of my input to create these blank templates for you. :)
<br>
Here is what they look like:<br>

* They all follow this format but the line numbers are all different.
* At the top of each notebook is the name of the group and a link to the group on CodingBat.
* Line 1 is the name of the problem.
* Line 3 is the problem.
* Line 9 is the function.
* Line 12 on are the sample problems.
  * I added print() to all of the samples so you can see the output more easily. 
<br>
Feel free to download and work the problems yourself. 
<br>
Use them however you like but please do not try to sell them (idk why you would but don't).

The theme that I'm using in VS Code is called Dracula.
